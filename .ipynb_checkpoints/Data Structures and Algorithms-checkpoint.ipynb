    "# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "My love for data structures and algorithms started in the second stage of my Computer Science degree. The first week of doing this, I absolutely hated it..... then I spent an hour with my teacher assistant and he described it so beautifully, I could't help but spend many hours as possible on this module. Other modules suffered as a result.  \n",

    "**Wiki defines Data Structures as:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**And Algorithms as:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In mathematics and computer scien\n",
    "ce, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ) is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.\""
